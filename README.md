## About Me ReadMe info:

1. What I did you do before GA:
	I worked full-time as a ux/web designer for PorchLight Real Estate on the development team. There I used agile project management software, wrote user stories and have a deep understanding of development workflows. I did website feature planning, UX research, UI planning and implementation, wireframes, and mock-ups of future work.

	My job before that was UX/web design at FRUITION, an internet marketing firm where I designed multiple websites and email marketing campagns.

2. Support I'll need most from Outomes?
	Help finding the places to apply to that I'll be happy at.

3. Day 1 goals for this course:
	To leave this course with the ability to develop my own websites from start to finish and get a job I enjoy.

4. Two truths and a lie about myself:
	I love chocolate cake and would eat it for every meal if I could.
	My partner/bf is 7 years younger than me.
	I have a tattoo on the inside of my lip.

5. LinkedIn Profile :
	https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-welborn-71156b9/

6. Kind of company I'd like to work for:
	I would love to be in a creative and/or agency invironment. I loved working in an agency becuase of the culture, being at the forefront of tech/best practices, and having a variety of work. That being said, where I go after the program does depend on the skills I've gained at GA. If I get to a solid level of front-end-dev, then I will probably work anywhere if I can learn a lot of fundamentals in one or two years.

7. Kind of role I'm leaning towards:
	I would love to be a hybrid wed designer/developer, but would be open to taking a strictly front-end development job or strictly web design job with development work opportunities.
