## About Me ReadMe info:

1. What you did you do before GA?
	I worked full-time for an in-house ux/web designer for PorchLight Real Estate

2. What kind of support do you think you'll need most from Outomes?
	Help finding the places to apply to that I'll be happy at.

3. What were were your Day 1 goals for this course?
	To leave this course with the ability to develop my own websites from start to finish and get a job I enjoy.

4. Give us two truths and a lie about yourself (don't tell us which are which!)
	I love chocolate cake and would eat it for every meal if I could.
	My partner/man/bf is 7 years younger than me.
	I have a tattoo on the inside of my lip.

5. Provide a link to your LinkedIn Profile 
	https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-welborn-71156b9/

6. Describe what kind of company you'd like to work for (i.e. Agency, Startup, etc)
	I would love to be in a creative invironment. I loved working in an agency becuase of the culture, being at the forefront of tech/best practices, and having a variety of work. That being said, where I go after the program does depend on the skills I've gained at GA. If I get to a solid level of front-end-dev, then I will probably work anywhere if I can learn a lot of fundamentals in one or two years.

7. Describe what kind of role you're leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)
	I would love to be a hybrid wed designer/developer, that is my ultimate goal, but I will need to strengthen my dev skills first, so I'll pretty much take what I can get as a jr dev.

8. Provide a link to your resume (it should be a file in your repo as well)
